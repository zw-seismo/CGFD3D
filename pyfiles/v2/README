+ --- Scripts to plot
+ draw_snap_pcolor.py
    Plot and save the seismic wavefield snapshot across a cross-section in pcolor style
+ draw_slice_pcolor.py
    Plot and save the seismic wavefield snapshot on a slice in pcolor style
+ draw_media_pcolor.py
    Plot and save the media across a cross-section in pcolor style
+ draw_metric_pcolor.py
    Plot and save the metric data across a cross-section in pcolor style
+ draw_seismo_line.py
    Plot and save the seismograms at the receivers and the whole line
+ draw_grid_coord.py
    Plot and save the grid/mesh generation and spacing


+ --- Necessary subfunctions to locate and gather data for the above drawing scripts
+ locate_snap.py
    Locate the processors/threads for the specific snapshot profile
+ locate_media.py
    Locate the processors/threads for the specific medium profile
+ locate_metric.py
    Locate the processors/threads for the specific metric profile
+ locate_coord.py
    Locate the processors/threads for the specific coordinates
+ gather_snap.py
    Gather and load the snapshot data
+ gather_media.py
    Gather and load the media data
+ gather_metric.py
    Gather and load the metric data
+ gather_coord.py
    Gather and load the coordinate data

 
* Usage for the drawing scripts:
    'python draw_xxx_xxx.py -h' in the terminal for the specific usage.

* Environment requirements:
    * python3.0+
    * modules: numpy, matplotlib, subprocess, argparse, obspy, imageio,\
               glob, netCDF4, os, sys, json
