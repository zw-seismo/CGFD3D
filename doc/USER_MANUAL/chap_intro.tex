\chapter{Brief Description of the Program}\label{chap_intro}

This manual is about how to use the program package for seismic wavefield forward modeling.This program is suitable for 3D acoustic wave equations and elastic wave equations.It can be applied to isotropic and anisotropic media. We can use the Cartesian grid and the curvilinear grid for calculation.

In this Program, we improved FDM to accurately simulate seismic wave propagation in the presence of surface topography in three ways: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using boundary-conforming grid to conform the grid with the surface. The grid can be used in the topography with steep slopes, and can avoid the artifact diffraction caused by staircase grid; 
	\item Using non-staggered higher-order optimized DRP /opt MacCormack scheme to solve the first order velocity- stress equations, which improves the compatibility of the velocity- stress approach for the anisotropic media and irregular surface;
	\item Developing a new numerical method, named as Traction Image method, to accurately and efficiently implement the traction-free boundary conditions in the presence of surface topography.  
	\end{enumerate}
We implemented the boundary-conforming grid, non-staggered DRP /opt MacCor- mack scheme and Traction Image method in SH, P-SV and 3D seismic wave modelling in the presence of surface topography.

This manual is mainly introduced from compiling, grid discretization, medium model, source and receivers setup, absorption boundary, result output, example display, for the convenience of users.
